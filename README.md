# Exercise Tracker app

This is my attempt to create my first full stack web application. The app is a exercise tracker with the initial aim of being able to create exercise routines and save them to a user.

The app consists of 3 layers, the client which is yet created, the API server and a database to persist the data.

The client will be built using React.js. I'm hoping to learn the technologies around routing and state management.

The API server will be a Sprint Boot Application with the aim of learning one of the most prominent backend frameworks.

The database is a PostgreSQL database, selected for is popularity. PostgreSQL Docker was used for this project for ease of use and access.
